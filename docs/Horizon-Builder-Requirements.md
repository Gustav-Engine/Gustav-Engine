#Horizon Builder

##Project Objective
To develop a character creation application for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, as a spiritual successor to the Aurora Builder application.

###Project Background
Aurora Builder was a character building application developed by Bas Driessen and released for public consumption in _year_. The application allows users to create XML files and import them as content into the application. This method has allowed Aurora Builder to support every D&D 5e source to date, along with numerous 3rd party sources and a significant body of homebrew content. The author eventually decided to abandon development on the Aurora Builder application for various reasons, and did not share the source code before ceasing contact, shutting down the Patreon, and all but disappearing. 
In the wake of this situation, several community members stepped up to maintain the Legacy of Aurora Builder. They continue to maintain the repositories of GitHub indices allowing the content to be shared and available for use by those creating characters. They also assist anyone who wishes to create homebrew content for Aurora and how to implement it.
From within this community of creators and codeheads, several attempts have been made to produce a successor to Aurora Builder. These have begun with the goal of trying to rectify many of the issues faced by Aurora left unfinished by its original author. Without access to the original code, this was almost impossible, and required starting from the ground up. Due to the sheer amount of work required to develop an application like this, all previous attempts have gone unfulfilled.
Horizon will be the exception, achieving where previously we have not been able to. The app will support 5e character creation, from official, 3rd party and homebrew sources, and provide tools for the D&D community to develop their own content for inclusion into the application. Horizon's aims are to incorporate the hard work produced in supporting Aurora, build upon it, fix the internal troubles, and add new and enhanced features, while staying true to its roots and providing compatibility to ingest and inherit Aurora files for use with the new Horizon app, ensuring continuity with past content and into the future.
